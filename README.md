# Netflix-Content-Analysis_IBM-Project
This project is part of the Capstone Project in the Data Classification and Summarization course I am taking with IBM and Hacktiv8. The goal of this project is to apply skills in data analysis, classification, and summarization using AI, as well as to communicate meaningful insights obtained through data-driven decision making.

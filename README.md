## AI Support Explanation

AI was used in this project in the following ways:

- **Summarization:** To help generate summaries of insights and findings from the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- **Recommendation Generation:** To formulate strategic recommendations based on patterns identified in the data.
- **Model Used:** IBM Granite Model, integrated via the Replicate API.

With the help of AI, the process of interpreting data became faster, more accurate, and resulted in richer narratives to support **data-driven decision making**.
